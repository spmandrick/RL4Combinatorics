# RL4Combinatorics

This repository contains the code for a project with the goal of using RL to find (counter)examples in combinatorics and graph theory.

The idea for this project is to see if we can expand on the success of A.Z. Wagner (see: https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14516), who used one of the simplest RL techniques, cross-entropy, to disprove several published conjectures in graph theory. 

That is, can we find more such counterexamples? Can we utilize more powerful techniques to better approach these problems?

I have obtained much of my knowledge on RL techniques from M. Lapan's _Deep Reinforcment Learning Hands-On_.
